WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net merger/next_reg_reg[state]__0_LDC_i_1_n_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin merger/next_reg_reg[state]__0_LDC_i_1/O, cell merger/next_reg_reg[state]__0_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
