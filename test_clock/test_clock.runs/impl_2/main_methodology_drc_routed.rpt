2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks zap and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks zap] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks zap and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#2 Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks zap and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0_1 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock  
The generated clock zap has a sub-optimal master source pin selection, timing can be pessimistic
Related violations: <none>
